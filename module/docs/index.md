``media``: Media file playback
==============================

The ``forge.media`` namespace allows you to play video or audio using native players.

##Config options

Enable Background Audio
:   If this is `true` then audio players will continue to play even when the app is running in the background.

Android, use 128kb/s constant bit-rate MP3 files.

The audio player object returned in the success callback has the
following methods, all of which take success and error callbacks in the
same manner as other Forge methods:

-  ``player.play(success, error)``: Begin (or resume) playing the audio
   file.
-  ``player.pause(success, error)``: Pause the playback of the file.
-  ``player.stop(success, error)``: Stop the playback of the file and
   release the audio system.
-  ``player.duration(success, error)``: Calls the success callback with
   the duration of the audio in seconds.
-  ``player.seek(seekTo, success, error)``: Seek to the given time (in
   seconds) in the audio file, if the file is playing it will continue
   to play after seeking.
-  ``player.positionChanged.addListener(callback, error)``: Add a listener to be called when the playback position changes, will be called at most once per second while the audio is playing, the callback will be called with the time in seconds of the current playback position.
-  ``player.destroy(success, error)``: Destroy and clean up any resources used by the native audio player.

**Example**:

    forge.file.getFileFromSourceDirectory("music.mp3", function (file) {
      forge.media.createAudioPlayer(file, function (player) {
        player.play();
      });
    });
